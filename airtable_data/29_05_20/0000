As the health service prepares for and is impacted by the direct effect of COVID-19, indirect effects also need consideration. Preventative medicine is a significant and important part of the role of primary care. When considering the withdrawal of preventative measures, appropriate risk-benefit analysis should occur. Certain aspects of preventative medicine may be deliverable via remote consulting, but even this may be scaled-back due to staff shortages. From a global perspective, UNICEF is concerned about the impact of a pause to childhood immunisations, which will inevitably disproportionately affect resource-poor countries ((https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060402)2). If there is a significant pause in routine immunisations, the resultant emergence of vaccine-preventable infections could place a further burden on health systems already severely impacted by the direct effects of COVID-19. The current guidance in the UK (as of 20th March) is \u2018Keep calm and carry on vaccinating\u2019 (Public Health England  (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873961/Vaccine_Update_306_March_2020.pdf)  issue 306, March 2020 ). Where children and their care givers are symptom-free (and not engaging in self-isolation), routine immunisations should continue as far as possible. Practices may need to restructure clinic schedules and procedures to augment social distancing and preventative measures (for further guidance see WHO  (http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/433813/Guidance-routine-immunization-services-COVID-19-pandemic.pdf?ua=1)   )  There may come a point where an individual practice\u2019s staffing levels do not permit a \u2018carry on vaccinating\u2019 approach. The immediate and acute need may take precedence over preventative measures. This decision may also be taken at a regional or national level. Where vaccines are missed, prioritisation should be given to appropriate catch-up programmes as soon as is possible. In response to front-line demand, there may be pausing of some screening programmes on a local or national level (e.g. 20th March \u2013 NHS Wales paused  (http://www.cervicalscreeningwales.wales.nhs.uk/home)). Even where screening is not formally paused, individuals may not be able to attend appointments due to self-isolation or care-giving responsibilities. Local staff availability may also be a factor \u2013 practices will understandably need to prioritise urgent activity and will need to work closely with public health services to execute catch-up provision at a later stage where possible. Irrespective of whether screening is paused, it is important to ensure that patients are encouraged to report symptoms that could be suggestive of cancer. There is the risk that patients confound screening and investigation of early symptoms and may therefore delay presentation unnecessarily.

Guidance on services for people experiencing rough sleeping is now available on the gov.uk website, recommending reduction measures for transmission of the virus within temporary/emergency accommodation venues. Prior to this, this group of people who developed a cough were being denied access to some night shelters and other facilities. People who are experiencing homelessness have the lowest life expectancy, which also means the greatest potential gain from interventions. Housing and appropriate support are probably the most effective interventions. This group of people have no ability to stockpile. Their day to day survival depends upon being mobile and sociable to obtain money, food and shelter. They have little ability to self-isolate. As such, they have been identified as significant vectors for disease spread. Some areas have helped large numbers of people experiencing homelessness into hotel accommodation. The government has made available funding to support this. It would be important that such efforts continue after this specific public health crisis passes. People become homeless for many reasons but there are common themes of multi-morbidity, social vulnerability and often addiction. People still have these problems in a hotel room. For many, now in accommodation, the move has been a major dislocation geographically, socially and from services. Needs should be assessed urgently, and services assembled around people to meet these needs. Services cannot rely on people with chaotic lives to come to them. Practices and those who commission services with people who are newly accommodated (previously homeless) should rapidly identify what the needs are and how these will be met.

COVID-19 is already affecting the availability of illicit drugs because of border and travel restrictions which are limiting the import of supplies and because of the inability of distributors to travel and dealers to dispense drugs. This means that the availability of drugs to substance users will be increasingly limited. Past drug famines give us some clues as to what to expect. When drugs are in short supply, quality tends to reduce with increased cutting, sometimes with other dangerous psychoactive substances. This can markedly increase harm and emergency presentations. When the amount of substance in a quantity reduces people may increase the amount they take to compensate, and this can increase the risk of overdose. We may also see increasing numbers of people presenting to GPs and specialist services for support coming off drugs or looking for opioid substitution therapy (OST). Substance-users are at high risk from respiratory infections (although we do not have specific data on COVID-19 yet). The risk is higher for those who smoke cigarettes and/or smoke drugs. Due to a driving necessity to secure drugs and the means to pay for them substance users are also identified as high risk for spreading the virus. Third sector drug and alcohol services may lack capacity to respond to increases in demand during the COVID-19 crisis. Shortfalls in services, including wider services like needle exchange programmes, will present a risk to individuals and to society. As part of working together, GPs are encouraged to communicate and coordinate with their local substance use services to meet the needs of this highly vulnerable population.

All doctors must comply with PPE advice and must follow other important protective measures such as handwashing and sanitization to protect themselves and others from infection. Early data suggest that healthcare workers are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, due to pathogen exposure. Data from previous similar epidemics suggest that appropriate use of PPE is strongly protective against infection. (Seto et al, Effectiveness of precautions against droplets and contact in prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Lancet, 2003 May 3;361(9368):1519-20.) New PPE guidance is now available at: (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control.). Healthcare professionals` concerns regarding PPE can be because of poor access to PPE (because PPE is unavailable or inadequate) or compromised ability to comply with PPE advice due to time or space limitations (e.g. if the time allocated between patient contacts is insufficient to allow clinicians to change PPE). The inadequacy of PPE for clinicians in primary care settings has been a major concern during the COVID-19 outbreak. The RCGP has been very active in advocating for provision of PPE. The degree of risk due to inadequate PPE will vary depending on the patient`s condition and the interaction or procedure as well as the vulnerability of the clinician to a) catching COVID-19 and b) suffering major ill health or dying. A clinician who sees a patient with a respiratory illness may be at greater risk than a clinician who sees someone with depression. CPR is a higher risk procedure than immunisation. A clinician who is on long-term steroids or who has a long-standing severe respiratory illness is more vulnerable to COVID-19. Clinicians in at-risk groups may need to consider not participating in frontline face-to-face interactions with patients. Instead, they can provide care through remote consultation and triage services. It should not be considered unethical if those who are at higher risk, reduce or abstain from frontline face-to-face contact with patients, especially if there is inadequate PPE available. Indeed, it should be considered unethical for a health system to expect a clinician at high-risk to be exposed to that risk without considering how this can be mitigated. All employers have a duty to ensure there is sufficient time to safely deploy PPE. This means not overbooking sessions and ensuring that there is enough time to safely change PPE between patients. Lack of access to PPE or compromised ability to comply with PPE advice need to be raised with the management of a healthcare organisation and a risk assessment will need to be undertaken. All clinicians must consider their obligations to patients as well as to themselves, their families, and their future ability to contribute. Clinicians should not be expected to treat patients without adequate PPE, even when under moral pressure to do so, due to the potential personal, patient and public health risk. Any pressure to do so should be reported under public interest disclosure (Freedom to Speak Up) duty, if clinicians have unsuccessfully raised their concerns through the usual formal channels within their healthcare organisation.

The health and wellbeing of children during the COVID-19 crisis has received much less attention than other areas. This is probably because the experience of other countries tells us that children, if symptomatic, are likely to have mild disease, are less likely to be hospitalised and highly unlikely to die from Corona virus. Children, however, can be vulnerable to the indirect and social consequences of COVID-19 and the pandemic response. Calls to Childline are increasing, as are reports of abuse. Social distancing and isolation measures can reduce access to protective safeguards whilst restricting children in often pressured home environments. As child poverty is growing, with an estimated 1.1 million more children expected to be living in poverty by 2022, many children are reliant on free school meals to eat. Some schools are working hard to replace this service, but others haven\u2019t been able to do so. Food insecurity is a problem that can be worsened by COVID-19 if donations to foodbanks plummet and a coordinated effort to address the problem is needed  Primary care teams should be particularly mindful of children, who will become a less visible part of the population during social distancing and isolation. Childhood immunisations are key services for the prevention of multiple communicable disease outbreaks in the future or concurrently with COVID-19. Safeguarding is probably more important than ever, and practices could consider creating supportive watchlists of families where there are concerns if those concerns do not meet the threshold for social services referral or intervention. Coordination with local social prescribing schemes and local authority interventions and working together with community group and foodbanks can help to ensure that patients have access to food and, in particular, children are not victims to the pandemic\u2019s socioeconomic sequelae. **Useful resources:**  Young Minds\u2019 guidance to looking after your mental health whilst isolating:  (https://youngminds.org.uk/blog/looking-after-your-mental-health-while-self-isolating/)/  Barnardo`s How to talk to your child about Coronavirus  (https://www.barnardos.org.uk/blog/how-talk-your-child-about-coronavirus)s  Parent Club \u2013 everything you need to know about Corona virus \u2013 tailored to age groups:  (https://www.parentclub.scot/)/  Local Government advice from Scotland on speaking to children about the virus:  (https://www.cosla.gov.uk/covid19-advice-supporting-children-and-young-people) ", "context_sent_idx": [[0, 59], [60, 174], [175, 387], [388, 503], [504, 563], [564, 713], [714, 883], [884, 977], [978, 1289], [1290, 1437], [1438, 1675], [1676, 1956], [1957, 2558]]}]}, {"title": "Has convalescent plasma transfusion been used before for coronavirus infections?", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Has convalescent plasma transfusion been used before for coronavirus infections?

We recommend tight seals for all ventilator circuitry and equipment. For patients who have a tracheostomy, similar recommendations apply. Although the efficacy is unproven, some experts suggest placing the ventilator and intravenous (IV) line monitors outside the room, when feasible (eg, through a wall port). This allows frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff; although the efficacy of such maneuvers is unproven. It is prudent to avoid unnecessary disconnection with the endotracheal tube (ETT) in ventilated patients with COVID-19 in order to avoid derecruitment and unnecessary exposure of virus to the environment. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable but is not always feasible. Other infection precautions include use of dual limb ventilator circuitry with filters placed at the exhalation outlets as well as heat moisture exchange (HME) systems rather than heated humification of single limb circuits. HME should be placed between the exhalation port and the ETT (figure 5 and figure 6).  It is particularly important to adhere to the standard practice of maintaining the ETT cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O so that a tight seal exists between the cuff and the tracheal wall.  All ventilators should have appropriate filters in place and agreed upon filter change schedule (eg, every six hours). The ventilator should be wiped down after every filter change.

Decision-making should not be disease specific (see advice at https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/news/ethical-guidance-published-frontline-staff-dealing-pandemic)  Information on the potential benefits and risks of a hospital admission needs to be communicated to the patients and their family/carers to facilitate a shared decision-making approach which incorporates the patient`s preferences and best interests. Having proactive conversations and anticipatory care planning with the most at-risk patients, can improve the quality of such decision making. Regular updates on hospital capacity can assist primary care decisions and good communication and close working with ambulance and secondary care colleagues are important in order to ensure the maximum benefit from existing resources. Increasingly such decisions may need to be made by remote consulting and primary care professionals will also be learning how to assess COVID-19 symptoms and patients\u2019 conditions remotely. Relevant advice on remote working can be found at: COVID-19: a remote assessment in primary care, by Greenhalgh, Koh and Car, BMJ 2020:  (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1182)2. However, working together and consulting colleagues, as much as possible, can assist with making difficult decisions and provide mutual support. Whilst referral for hospital treatment may not be always clinically appropriate or acceptable to the patient, all patients should receive compassionate medical care, including appropriate symptom management and, where patients are dying, the best available end-of-life care.

One approach would be to combine the use of convalescent plasma and H-Ig in a complementary way to treat infected patients in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent infectious waves, perhaps with the following steps and considerations. First, blood centers could start collecting plasma from convalescent donors, preferably at the leading edge of the infectious wave; health care workers could encourage COVID-19\u2013infected patients to donate after hospital discharge. Plasma would be tested, frozen, and distributed to hospitals; paired samples would be retained for concurrent investigations. Second, within days of collection, clinicians could transfuse convalescent plasma to infected patients. This approach would be expected to be most effective in patients before they develop a humoral response to COVID-19; serology tests that detect COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies would be beneficial in identifying the best treatment candidates. Monitoring patient responses by clinical, laboratory, and imaging results could be compared against antibody titers, specificities, and neutralizing activities in paired plasma samples to develop better algorithms for identifying patient and donor factors that predict clinical efficacy. Third, funding to expand plasma collection capabilities, as well as for academic, industry, and government research initiatives, could mobilize these efforts. However, despite potentially rapid availability, the deployment of convalescent plasma will have limited reach because transfusions are typically performed in hospital settings and may require large infusion volumes. In addition, plasma transfusions are also associated with adverse events ranging from mild fever and allergic reactions to life-threatening bronchospasm, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and circulatory overload in patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, which must be carefully tracked.3 There is also a small, but nonzero, risk of infectious disease transmission. Fourth, dynamic modeling of COVID-19 infections and factors that are associated with clinical efficacy could be used to inform the distribution of convalescent plasma (and donors) between blood centers and the source plasma industry so the latter can manufacture concentrated COVID-19 H-Ig. Fifth, within several months, it could be possible for clinicians to begin using small volume H-Ig preparations in ambulatory settings and drive-through clinics, as well as in hospitals. Concentrated H-Ig preparations are an injectable, time-tested treatment for viral (eg, hepatitis A and B) and bacterial (eg, tetanus, diphtheria) diseases. In principle, each dose delivers antibody preparations with accurately determined specificities, affinities, and titers against COVID-19 and is logistically simpler than plasma to distribute worldwide.

Until recently, HCoVs received relatively little attention due to their mild phenotypes in humans. This changed in 2002, when cases of severe atypical pneumonia were described in Guangdong Province, China, causing worldwide concern as disease spread via international travel to more than 2 dozen countries.2 The new disease became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a beta-HCoV, named SARS-CoV, was identified as the causative agent. Because early cases shared a history of human-animal contact at live game markets, zoonotic transmission of the virus was strongly suspected.3 Palm civets and raccoon dogs were initially thought to be the animal reservoir(s); however, as more viral sequence data became available, consensus emerged that bats were the natural hosts. Common symptoms of SARS included fever, cough, dyspnea, and occasionally watery diarrhea.2 Of infected patients, 20% to 30% required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, with higher fatality rates in older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Human-to-human transmission was documented, mostly in health care settings. This nosocomial spread may be explained by basic virology: the predominant human receptor for the SARS S glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper airway. Receptor distribution may account for both the dearth of upper respiratory tract symptoms and the finding that peak viral shedding occurred late (\u224810 days) in illness when individuals were already hospitalized. SARS care often necessitated aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation, which also may have contributed to the prominent nosocomial spread. Several important transmission events did occur in the community, such as the well-characterized mini-outbreak in the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong from where infected patrons traveled and spread SARS internationally. Another outbreak occurred at the Amoy Gardens housing complex where more than 300 residents were infected, providing evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can sometimes occur.4 Nearly 20 years later, the factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV, ranging from self-limited animal-to-human transmission to human superspreader events, remain poorly understood. Ultimately, classic public health measures brought the SARS pandemic to an end, but not before 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died.2 The pandemic cost the global economy an estimated $30 billion to $100 billion.1 SARS-CoV demonstrated that animal CoVs could jump the species barrier, thereby expanding perception of pandemic threats.", "context_sent_idx": [[0, 13], [14, 112], [113, 467], [468, 800], [801, 1053], [1054, 1129], [1130, 1378], [1379, 1589], [1590, 1736], [1737, 1953], [1954, 2329], [2330, 2671]]}]}, {"title": "Why is Vitamin D considered for COVID-19 treatment or prevention?", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Why is Vitamin D considered for COVID-19 treatment or prevention?

As LPVr is a protease inhibitor, it may inhibit the action of 3CLpro, thereby disrupting the process of viral replication and release from host cells. Recent evidence suggests that lopinavir has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. However, coronavirus proteases, including 3CLpro, do not contain a C2-symmetric pocket, which is the target of HIV protease inhibitors, leading some to question the potential potency of HIV protease inhibitors in treating these viruses. Darunavir, another HIV protease inhibitor, is reportedly not active against SARS-CoV-2 in an unpublished in vitro study, and a recent study using in vitro and mouse models found stronger evidence for anti MERS-CoV activity for the antiviral Remdesivir compared to LPVr.

Intubation is the highest risk procedure for droplet dispersion in patients with COVID-19. The following discussion is suitable for patients outside the operating room (eg, intensive care unit  and emergency department) (table 2). - We are proponents of the development of intubation kits and intubation checklists for performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in this population (figure 1). - Attention should be paid to donning full contact and airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) (figure 2 and figure 3). Appropriate PPE includes a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator mask (picture 3), with eye protection or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), also known as an isolation suit (picture 4 and picture 5). Also included are gown, caps and beard covers, protective footwear, and gloves (using the double glove technique).  - Intubation should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, if possible. - Intubation should be performed by the most qualified individual (eg, anesthesiologist) since delayed intubation with multiple attempts may prolong dispersion and place the patient at risk of a respiratory arrest.   - Anecdotally, most experts suggest optimizing preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means (eg, avoidance of high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannula) and intubation using video laryngoscopy. In patients previously on high flow oxygen, some experts switch to 100 percent nonrebreather masks for preoxygenation. - When manual bag mask ventilation (BMV) is needed, switching the mask to a supraglottic device for manual bagging is appropriate. When feasible, BMV should be minimized before and after intubation, and a bacterial/viral high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be placed between the facemask and breathing circuit or resuscitation bag. Having a pre-prepared bag-mask with filter attached in every room with a COVID-19 patient is prudent. Using a two-person technique for an adequate face mask seal is also suggested. - Clamping the endotracheal tube (ETT) for connections and disconnections is appropriate (eg, capnography testing following intubation). - The ventilator and ventilator circuitry should be ready in advance with preplanned settings already entered so that as soon as the ETT is placed and confirmed with capnography, it can be connected directly to the ETT without additional manual bagging. In addition, if feasible, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy should be prepared and attached to the ventilator tubing in advance in order to avoid unnecessary disconnection for their placement at a later point in time.

Patients are often ready for extubation while they remain infectious, and because extubation is frequently associated with some coughing, it is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Readiness for extubation should follow standard practice of performing spontaneous breathing trials. However, we suggest using closed systems and not using a T-piece. To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness in patients with COVID-19, since extubation directly to high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is not desirable due to the risk of virus aerosolization. Whether the cuff leak test should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. However, its performance may be guided by clinical suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the presence of risk factors for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation \u22656 days, age >80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). Performing the cuff leak test should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room.  We prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. Extra care should be taken during extubation to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation. The endotracheal tube should be removed as smoothly as is feasible, and disposed of in the standard fashion.

This is incredibly hard and represents a genuine dilemma. As a healthcare professional you have obligations to patients and your employer, but also have obligations to your family. What can you do if those obligations clash? There is no straightforward answer, and much may depend on the exact nature of your concern. Are your concerns about leaving your family whilst you are working, or are they about exposing your family to risk of infection?  How you resolve this will be very personal and will depend on your unique situation. Are you a single parent? Are you struggling with childcare? Do you live with people who have care needs or who are particularly vulnerable? Are you at increased health risk from COVID-19 infection? Are there ways that you can amend your working hours or duties according to your circumstances and needs?  The GMC requires doctors to \u2018make the care of the patient your first concern\u2019 (Good Medical Practice). At first glance, this would seem to negate all personal and family-related responsibilities. Sokol argues in his BMJ critique of this edict that \u2018in extreme circumstances \u2013 such as epidemics, where treating patients involves a high risk of infection and modest benefit to patients \u2013 doctors\u2019 obligations to their children, parents, siblings and loved ones may take priority over the care of patients.\u2019 His suggested amendment to the original edict is \u2018Make the care of your patient your first concern, bearing in mind your other patients and their particular needs, as well as any protective obligations to the broader community and obligations you may have towards others for whom you are responsible.\u2019 ((https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.d646))  Overall, a 'greater good' approach might suggest that you should do whatever you can to mitigate the possible harms to your family and continue to work. But it is not that simple if you are unable to mitigate those risks and harms (see  (https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-9-56)  on Healthcare workers' attitudes to working during pandemic). According to the principle of  **reciprocity**, if people are asked to take increased risks, or face increased burdens, during a pandemic, they should be supported in doing so. Employers and organisations need to minimise these risks and burdens as far as possible. In summary, you may have a clash of obligations that cannot be easily and simply reconciled. You need to think about the risks and harms of working versus not working, reflect on which are more serious and consider with your practice/employer how either can be mitigated. Ultimately, if you can find ways to mitigate the risks for your family, then you do have a professional responsibility to do that and continue to work. If you haven\u2019t already done so, you may wish to discuss your particular situation with appropriate colleagues and your employer.

Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP) is about having conversations with patients and their family/carers before they become ill, and less capable of making treatment or care decisions. This is not new. It is about respecting patient autonomy and choice as expressed before a situation arises. It is considered that many patients who are vulnerable to the serious complications of COVID-19 should have such conversations with their GPs, or any trained member of the Primary Care team. Ideally it should be a clinician known to the patient, but this may not be possible. Good clinical communication skills are important. Flexibility will be required when choosing the method and place for ACP conversations given the social and workload constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such conversations take time to do well. Primary care teams should exercise their judgement as to how and where such time is utilised, bearing in mind other clinical commitments and the availability of remote (telephone or video) ways of consulting. The principle underlying these conversations is to establish and respect the autonomous preferences of patients, who are often vulnerable, on the types of care they would like to receive in the event of getting infected with COVID-19, or any other serious or life-threatening illness. The place where they would ideally like to receive that care, is also important to discuss. A personalised, shared decision between patient and clinician is the goal.

You do have an obligation to care for your patients - which applies to any patient to whom you have formal 'duty of care'. For primary health care professionals, that is almost always the registered patient. However, that duty is limited by the risk that you might be exposed to in discharging it. For example, it would not be an obligation to enter a burning building to care for a patient. The GMC recognises this limitation. You are not required to sacrifice your own health and/or wellbeing. At the same time, there are some situations when one may be morally required to accept some risks in order to care for others. It is important to keep in mind that any risk you choose to expose yourself to, should be proportionate to the good you can bring about. All clinicians must consider their obligations to patients as well as to themselves, their families, and their future ability to contribute.

In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. Airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before entering the room. Using PPE similar to that described for intubation is appropriate. Using ETTs with inline adapters for bronchoscopy is ideal to prevent disconnection from the ventilator and aerosolization. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, then we suggest small aliquots of 10 mL to obtain 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid placed in a sterile leak-proof container.

It is a competitive inhibitor of IL-6-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a cytokine involved in haemopoiesis, acute phase reactions, and immune responses, such as T-cell activation and induction of immunoglobulin secretion. It is produced by T- and B-lymphocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts, and other cells. Excessive production of IL-6 is implicated in, for example, multiple myeloma and rheumatoid arthritis. In an animal model, tocilizumab suppressed the development of arthritis and the synthesis of C-reactive protein (CRP). Circulating IL-6 concentrations are raised in patients with SARS and COVID-19.

Furthermore, Savarino et al  hypothesise that CQ might block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-6), thereby blocking the pathway that subsequently leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some viruses enter host cells through endocytosis; the virus is transported within the host cell in a cell-membrane derived vesicle called an endosome, within which the virus can replicate. When the endosome fuses with the acidic intracellular lysosome, this leads to rupture of the endosome with the release of the viral contents.

However, their administration in **critically ill** patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is **controversial**.

We are used to treating the patient in front of us and moving to a virtual and triage mindset can be difficult and uncomfortable.

Moral distress or injury is a negative emotional response to being unable to act in the way you feel you should, or simply unable to determine the right course of action. It is important to remember that these kinds of decisions will often be moral dilemmas, where you have an obligation to do two or more mutually incompatible courses of action and are forced to choose between them.

For people with asthma, the best way of staying healthy and recovering if infected with COVID-19 is to ensure their asthma is as stable as possible. This means taking inhaled steroids and other routine medications regularly, as prescribed and detailed in their personal asthma action plan. Having a reliever inhaler is also important if asthma worsens. Ensuring people have had their inhaler technique checked recently is important and you can share this (https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/). Advise patients to ensure they have a sufficient supply of their medication at home and order them in plenty of time to ensure they do not run out. Emphasise that they do not need to over order/ stock up on their inhalers and they should not share their inhalers or spacers with family / friends. Continue to provide monthly repeat prescriptions rather than writing a prescription for several months. Very few people with asthma need to use a nebuliser outside of hospital and in general it should be discouraged because using salbutamol through a spacer can be as effective:  -  4-6 puffs from a salbutamol pMDI into a spacer with a patient taking 2-3 tidal breaths is the same as a 2.5mg nebule of salbutamol  -  10-12 puffs is the equivalent of a 5mg nebule of salbutamol. Those who have been prescribed a nebuliser should continue to use it as directed. The advice from Public Health England is that nebulisation is not a VIRAL droplet generating procedure and not considered an aerosol generating procedure for COVID-19. As the number of cases of COVID-19 is increasing, it is natural for some patients to feel concerned or anxious. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack.

Yes. Alternate prenatal care delivery approaches have been proposed as a strategy in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19 among patients, caregivers, and staff. Although evidence is limited regarding the safety and efficacy of these approaches, ACOG recognizes the need to implement innovative strategies during this rapidly evolving public health emergency, with consideration of differences in care settings and population risks. Any decision to modify prenatal care delivery should be made at the local and individual level. Obstetrician\u2013gynecologists and other obstetric care clinicians should continue to provide medically necessary prenatal care, referrals, and consultations. Obstetric care clinicians should be prepared to explain the rationale for any change in prenatal care or delivery scheduling, emphasizing that these modifications have been made in order to limit the risk of exposure to the virus for the mother and the fetus or infant. It is recommended that the patient\u2013physician discussion regarding a plan for alternate prenatal care in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic be documented in the medical record. Some examples of approaches to modifying prenatal care that may be considered are listed below. However, modifying or reducing care is only appropriate because the risk of inadvertent exposure from receiving or delivering care can be high at this time; normal care approaches and schedules should resume when this risk subsides. Plans for modified care are best made at the local level with consideration of patient populations and available resources. Spacing out appointments. Health care clinicians may choose to continue in-person prenatal care appointments for patients who are not sick, if staffing is available, but space out in-person appointment times where appropriate to reduce the number of patients in the office or facility at one time. This may be accompanied by postponing some nonemergent gynecologic or well-woman appointments to facilitate social distancing and to maintain availability to accommodate medically necessary appointments; appointments for which a delay will negatively affect patient health and safety should not be delayed. Alternate or reduced prenatal care schedules.

A large proportion of GP consultations are about mental health issues. People with severe mental health conditions are known to have poorer physical health outcomes. They are also at higher risk of loneliness and social isolation. In deprived areas, mental health problems are more prevalent. Many practices have replaced their routine appointments with on-the-day urgent access slots. There is therefore a risk that people with mental health issues are only assessed at times of crisis. The pandemic and its consequences may result in a marked worsening of mental health conditions. There are several resources on the management of mental health and well-being during social isolation measures, but these mostly focus on the effects on the previously well population and not on those with pre-existing mental health conditions. Whilst prioritisation of urgent cases is important, space must be made for reviewing the mental health of those at risk of deterioration, before any crisis presentation. Some practices are creating a greater number of shorter counselling slots, delivered by phone or video, to cater for the predicted increased demand for advice. Other practices are making short videos with anxiety management techniques that patients can watch on the practice`s website.
