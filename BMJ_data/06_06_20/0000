This confirms that person-to-person spread occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019, including infections in healthcare workers. - It is uncertain how easily the virus spreads between people, but transmission in chains involving several links has been recognised. Available evidence indicates that human transmission occurs via close contact with respiratory droplets produced when a person exhales, sneezes, or coughs; via direct contact with infected people; or via contact with fomites. Airborne transmission has not been reported; however, it may be possible during aerosol-generating procedures performed in clinical care. - The virus has been found to be more stable on plastic and stainless steel (up to 72 hours) compared with copper (up to 4 hours) and cardboard (up to 24 hours). This study also found that the virus was viable in aerosol particles for up to 3 hours; however, aerosols were generated using high-powered apparatus that do not reflect normal human cough conditions or a clinical setting where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. The World Health Organization has confirmed that there have been no reports of airborne transmission. In healthcare settings, the virus is widely distributed in the air and on object surfaces (e.g., floors, rubbish bins, sickbed handrails, and computer mice) in both general wards and intensive care units, with a greater risk of contamination in the intensive care unit. - The contribution to transmission by the presence of the virus in other body fluids is unknown; however, the virus has been detected in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, saliva, tears, and conjunctival secretions. Faecal-oral transmission may be possible (virus has been detected in the stool samples of almost half of the patients in one meta-analysis), although it has not been reported yet. Patients with diarrhoea are more likely to have viral RNA in their stool. The presence of virus in these fluids or viral RNA shedding does not necessarily equate with infectivity. - Nosocomial transmission in healthcare workers and patients has been reported in 41% of patients in one case series. The majority of healthcare workers with COVID-19 reported contact in the healthcare setting. In a study of over 9000 cases reported in healthcare workers in the US, 55% had contact only in a healthcare setting, 27% only in a household, 13% only in the community, and 5% in more than one setting. Screening of healthcare workers in a hospital trust in the UK found that 14% of healthcare workers tested positive. - Widespread transmission has been reported in long-term care facilities, homeless shelters, and prisons, and on cruise ships (19% of 3700 passengers and crew were infected aboard the Diamond Princess). - Clusters of cases originating from family gatherings have been reported, emphasising the importance of social distancing even within families. - Clusters of cases originating from mass gatherings have been reported; for example, approximately 8% of attendees of the Sri Petaling gathering (Moslem missionary movement) in Kuala Lumpur tested positive. - The secondary attack rate among all close contacts is approximately 0.45% to 0.7%. The secondary attack rate among household members is higher and ranges from 4.6% to 30%.

There are several treatments being used off-label (use of a licensed medication for an indication that has not been approved by a national drug regulatory authority), on a compassionate-use basis, or as part of a randomised controlled trial. It is important to note that there may be serious adverse effects associated with these drugs, and that these adverse effects may overlap with the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. These drugs may also increase the risk of death in an older patient or a patient with an underlying health condition. For example, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir can all prolong the QT interval and are all potentially associated with an increased risk of cardiac death. Drug-drug interactions with the patient\u2019s existing medication(s) must also be considered (e.g., antivirals can interact with many drugs including direct oral anticoagulants). The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners have launched the Solidarity trial, a large international study to compare four different treatments (local standard of care plus remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon beta, or hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) compared with local standard of care alone (which may include other experimental drug therapies as part of local standard of care).", "context_sent_idx": [[0, 196], [197, 438], [439, 622], [623, 740], [741, 944], [945, 1119], [1120, 1544]]}]}, {"title": "BMJ_COVID_209", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are oral drugs that have been used for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, and the treatment of certain autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Both drugs have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency. They are being trialled in patients for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19. They are also being trialled for prevention and post-exposure prophylaxis in the healthcare setting. Initial data is promising, but is currently limited. A small randomised controlled trial found that hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) was efficient in reducing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in 3 to 6 days in most patients. However, this trial has been criticised for its limitations, and results from a similar trial could not replicate these findings. Another randomised trial in 62 patients in China found that hydroxychloroquine may shorten time to clinical recovery (in terms of resolution of fever and cough, and improvement of pneumonia on computed tomographic imaging); however, this study has not been peer reviewed as yet. Early results from the largest randomised controlled trial completed so far of 150 people in China found that the overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not significantly different between patients who received hydroxychloroquine and those who received standard of care. However, addition of hydroxychloroquine led to more rapid normalisation of C-reactive protein levels and recovery of baseline lymphopenia, which may be important. The time to alleviation of symptoms was shorter compared with standard of care in the subgroup of patients who did not receive antiviral treatment in the post-hoc analysis. The rate of adverse effects was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group (diarrhoea being the most common adverse effect). This study has not been peer reviewed yet and has several limitations (e.g., delay between symptom onset and starting treatment, inclusion of other antiviral therapies in the standard of care group). Hydroxychloroquine has similar therapeutic effects to chloroquine, but fewer adverse effects, is considered safe in pregnancy, and is more readily available in some countries. Both drugs must be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease due to the risk of arrhythmias. Because chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can both cause QT interval prolongation, caution is recommended when using these drugs together. A preprint study (not peer reviewed) found an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19. This combination is not recommended except in the context of a clinical trial. Caution is recommended with the dosing regimen used for chloroquine due to the risk of chloroquine poisoning. Higher doses of chloroquine have been associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation compared with lower doses, especially when used in combination with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Guidelines in China and Italy recommend these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19; however, this is based on weak evidence. Surviving Sepsis Campaign and National Institutes of Health guidelines concluded that there is insufficient evidence to offer any recommendation on use of these drugs in the intensive care unit. The American Thoracic Society recommends that either drug may be used on a case-by-case basis provided the patient\u2019s condition is severe enough to warrant investigational therapy, the benefits and risks of treatment are discussed with the patient, data is collected on outcomes, and the drug is not in short supply. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has stressed that these drugs have not been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 as yet, and should only be used in the context of clinical trials or emergency-use programmes. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an emergency-use authorisation for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients when a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible. It recommends that these drugs should not be used outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to the risk of arrhythmias, especially when used in combination with azithromycin.
